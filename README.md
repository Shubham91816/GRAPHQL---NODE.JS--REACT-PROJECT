In GRAPHQL-NODEJS Project I used node.js in backend & React in frontend i hardcoded data in todo.js file & user.js file in backend  , created a ApolloServer and write typeDef & Query 
In front end  use React js library define Query  & uses useQuery  method of apolloclient to fetch data from backend 
This whole project teaches the importance of GraphQl api (We can fetch the data accoring to our need)
